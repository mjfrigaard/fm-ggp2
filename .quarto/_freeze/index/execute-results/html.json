    "markdown": "# Welcome! {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the `ggplot2` field manual! \n\nI created this book as a sort of online 'quick reference' to help me answer questions like:[^tidytuesday-twitter-callout]  \n\n  - \"*What graph should I use?*\"  \n  \n  - \"*What kind of graph is that?*\n  \n  - \"*Can (or should) I build that graph?*\"\n\n[^tidytuesday-twitter-callout]: *Most of these questions come from [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%23tidytuesday)*\n\n## Getting started\n\n-   Option 1: install `ggplot2` using the code below:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](www/ggplot2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"}\n:::\n\n\n\n-   Option 2 (recommended): `ggplot2` is also part of the `tidyverse` \n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\n    install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n    library(tidyverse)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n![](www/tidyverse.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"40%\" height=\"40%\"}\n:::\n\n\n## Who this book was written for\n\nI created this resource with the following [learner personas](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas) in mind: \n\n1. **Garth** is a data analyst putting together a slide deck for an upcoming meeting. He had a few statistics courses with R in college, and has picked up additional experience and skills from the different positions he's held and various online tutorials. He's currently building the graphs in his slides with `ggplot2`, but had grown tired of them and would like to customize his presentation to make it more engaging. \n\n2. **Matilda** is a data journalist hoping to add a few graphs to a piece she has been working on. She has 10 years of experience working with WordPress, writes and publishes on her own blog, and has an intermediate understanding of HTML & CSS. However, she has only been programming in R for about 6 months.\n\n3. **Igor** is a researcher who has been working in academia for 15 years. He's comfortable writing R code, knows the kinds of graphs he'd like to build, but he only knows how to build these using the [base R graphics](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html). He'd like to learn how to duplicate the graphs he's already created in base R using `ggplot2`.\n\n### Where to learn more \n\nBecause this is intended to be a field manual (and not a textbook), I've omitted most of the underlying principles and structure of the `ggplot2` syntax. \n\nIf you're looking for comprehensive resources on `ggplot2`, I recommend the [excellent free text](https://ggplot2-book.org/), the [`ggplot2` website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and [Data Visualization: a practical guide](https://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy. \n\nIf you know the graph you'd like to build, and you're just looking for the code or package(s) to build it, I'd check out the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) or [R graphics cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/). \n\nAnother question to consider--but not covered in this manual--is, \"*who will the audience be for this graph?*\" \n\nGreat resources for this include [Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Data-Art-Writing-Science/dp/0198862741) by Deborah Nolan and Sara Stoudt and [Truthful Art, The: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication](https://www.amazon.com/Truthful-Art-Data-Charts-Communication/dp/0321934075/), by  Alberto Cairo.\n\n\n",
