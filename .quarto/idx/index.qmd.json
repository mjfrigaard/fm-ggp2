He had a few statistics courses with R in college, and has picked up additional experience and skills from the different positions he's held and various online tutorials. He's currently building the graphs in his slides with `ggplot2`, but had grown tired of them and would like to customize his presentation to make it more engaging. \n\n2. **Matilda** is a data journalist hoping to add a few graphs to a piece she has been working on. She has 10 years of experience working with WordPress, writes and publishes on her own blog, and has an intermediate understanding of HTML & CSS. However, she has only been programming in R for about 6 months.\n\n3. **Igor** is a researcher who has been working in academia for 15 years. He's comfortable writing R code, knows the kinds of graphs he'd like to build, but he only knows how to build these using the [base R graphics](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html). He'd like to learn how to duplicate the graphs he's already created in base R using `ggplot2`.\n\n## Where to learn more \n\nBecause this is intended to be a field manual (and not a textbook), I've omitted most of the underlying principles and structure of the `ggplot2` syntax. \n\nIf you're looking for comprehensive resources on `ggplot2`, I recommend the [excellent free text](https://ggplot2-book.org/), the [`ggplot2` website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and [Data Visualization: a practical guide](https://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy. \n\nIf you know the graph you'd like to build, and you're just looking for the code or package(s) to build it, I'd check out the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) or [R graphics cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/). \n\nAnother question to consider--but not covered in this manual--is, \"*who will the audience be for this graph?*\" \n\nGreat resources for this include the [Insightful Data Visualizations for \"Uncreative\" R Users](https://arapp.thinkific.com/courses/insightful-data-visualizations-for-uncreative-r-users) course by Albert Rapp, [Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Data-Art-Writing-Science/dp/0198862741) by Deborah Nolan and Sara Stoudt, and the [Truthful Art, The: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication](https://www.amazon.com/Truthful-Art-Data-Charts-Communication/dp/0321934075/), by  Alberto Cairo.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"fig-asp":0.618,"df-print":"paged","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"show","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":"arrow","toc":true,"toc-depth":5,"number-sections":true,"dpi":320,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
