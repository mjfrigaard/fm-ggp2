Welcome to the `ggplot2` field manual! 

I created this book as a sort of online 'quick reference' to help me answer questions like:[^tidytuesday-twitter-callout]  

  - "*What graph should I use?*"  
  
  - "*What kind of graph is that?*
  
  - "*Can (or should) I build that graph?*"

[^tidytuesday-twitter-callout]: *Most of these questions come from [#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=%23tidytuesday)*

## Getting started

-   Option 1: install `ggplot2` using the code below:

    ```{r}
    #| label: ggp2-pkg
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    #| code-fold: false
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

::: {.column-margin}

:::



-   Option 2 (recommended): `ggplot2` is also part of the `tidyverse` 

    ```{r}
    #| label: tidyverse-pkg
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true
    #| code-fold: false
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

## Who this book was written for

I created this resource with the following [learner personas](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas) in mind: 

1. **Garth** is a data analyst putting together a slide deck for an upcoming meeting. He had a few statistics courses with R in college, and has picked up additional experience and skills from the different positions he's held and various online tutorials. He's currently building the graphs in his slides with `ggplot2`, but had grown tired of them and would like to customize his presentation to make it more engaging. 

2. **Matilda** is a data journalist hoping to add a few graphs to a piece she has been working on. She has 10 years of experience working with WordPress, writes and publishes on her own blog, and has an intermediate understanding of HTML & CSS. However, she has only been programming in R for about 6 months.

3. **Igor** is a researcher who has been working in academia for 15 years. He's comfortable writing R code, knows the kinds of graphs he'd like to build, but he only knows how to build these using the [base R graphics](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/the-base-plotting-system-1.html). He'd like to learn how to duplicate the graphs he's already created in base R using `ggplot2`.

### Where to learn more 

Because this is intended to be a field manual (and not a textbook), I've omitted most of the underlying principles and structure of the `ggplot2` syntax. 

If you're looking for comprehensive resources on `ggplot2`, I recommend the [excellent free text](https://ggplot2-book.org/), the [`ggplot2` website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and [Data Visualization: a practical guide](https://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy. 

If you know the graph you'd like to build, and you're just looking for the code or package(s) to build it, I'd check out the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) or [R graphics cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/). 

Another question to consider--but not covered in this manual--is, "*who will the audience be for this graph?*" 

Great resources for this include the [Insightful Data Visualizations for "Uncreative" R Users](https://arapp.thinkific.com/courses/insightful-data-visualizations-for-uncreative-r-users) course by Albert Rapp, [Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Data-Art-Writing-Science/dp/0198862741) by Deborah Nolan and Sara Stoudt, and the [Truthful Art, The: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication](https://www.amazon.com/Truthful-Art-Data-Charts-Communication/dp/0321934075/), by  Alberto Cairo.
